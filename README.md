## 📘 Overview  
The **Medicine Stock & Expiry Management System** is an assembly-level application developed using **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)** and the **Irvine32 library**.  
It provides a streamlined way to manage pharmaceutical stock data, record quantities, and identify expired medicines - all at the machine-level programming layer.

This project demonstrates low-level data management, memory handling, and user interaction in assembly language, aligned with **Computer Organization and Assembly Language (COAL)** course objectives.
